# Tube Mail: Discovery mDNS

This is just a helper module for [Tube Mail](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail). This module can be used to enable mDNS-based discovery.

The used mdns module requires the package named ```libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev``` for a successful ```npm install``` on Debian-flavoured systems.
